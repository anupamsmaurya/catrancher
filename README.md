# Catrancher App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app separates the cats into groups of 3
cats (a clowder) that get along. In order to avoid cat fights in the clowder, each cat in the group
must either be the same or different from every cat in the group for each attribute.

### `yarn start`
